a) High-resolution video analytics
b) Unique identification and tracking of tagged objects
c) Long-range broadband communication
d) On-device machine learning
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The RFID section explains that tags and readers allow automatic identification and tracking of objects, forming a key IoT building block. (Ref: Page 6)

**4. Which component in an RFID system contains the object-specific data?**
a) RFID reader
b) Antenna array
c) RFID tag
d) Edge gateway
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The chapter notes that RFID tags store identifying information that is read by the RFID reader. (Ref: Page 6)

**5. In IoT, actuators are best described as devices that:**
a) Convert mechanical energy into heat
b) Translate control signals into physical actions
c) Only gather environmental data
d) Perform long-term cloud storage
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Actuators receive commands and cause physical changes such as movement, switching, or adjustment. (Ref: Page 8)

**6. Which of the following is an example of a closed-loop IoT control involving sensors and actuators?**
a) Manual switching of lights
b) A thermostat adjusting heating based on room temperature
c) A barcode scanned once at checkout
d) A static HTML dashboard
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The chapter illustrates feedback-based automatic control where sensor readings drive actuator behavior. (Ref: Page 9)

**7. Smart objects in IoT are characterized by their ability to:**
a) Only sense the environment
b) Only communicate with gateways
c) Sense, process, and communicate contextual information
d) Operate entirely offline without identifiers
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Smart objects integrate sensing, processing, and communication to participate autonomously in IoT applications. (Ref: Page 10)

**8. Which technology is highlighted as a key enabler for automatic, non-line-of-sight identification in supply chain IoT?**
a) GPS
b) QR codes
c) RFID
d) Infrared sensors
**Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The chapter emphasizes RFID’s role in logistics for contactless and bulk identification. (Ref: Page 7)

**9. What is the primary role of unique identifiers (UIDs) in IoT devices?**
a) Encrypting network traffic
b) Ensuring each device/object can be distinctly addressed and managed
c) Providing backup power
d) Improving wireless signal strength
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** UIDs are introduced as essential for mapping physical objects to their digital representations. (Ref: Page 11)

**10. Which statement best differentiates passive RFID tags from active RFID tags?**
a) Passive tags have their own power source; active tags do not
b) Passive tags rely on reader power induction; active tags contain a battery
c) Both require continuous wired power
d) Passive tags support longer read ranges than active tags
**Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The classification section explains that passive tags are powered by the reader’s field, while active tags use an internal battery. (Ref: Page 6)

### Short Answer Questions - 4 points each

**11. Define an IoT sensor and provide one example from the chapter.**
**Answer:** An IoT sensor measures a physical quantity and converts it into an electrical/digital signal; e.g., a temperature sensor used to monitor room temperature.
**Explanation:** This follows the chapter’s definition and examples of temperature and environmental sensors. (Ref: Page 3)

**12. Explain the role of RFID in IoT-based inventory or supply chain management.**
**Answer:** RFID enables automatic identification and tracking of items via tagged objects and readers, supporting real-time inventory visibility and reduced manual scanning.
**Explanation:** The RFID section describes its application in logistics and inventory tracking. (Ref: Page 7)

**13. What is an actuator in an IoT system? Give one use case mentioned in the material.**
**Answer:** An actuator converts control commands into physical actions, such as a smart valve adjusting water flow or a relay switching a device on/off.
**Explanation:** The chapter highlights actuators as effectors that implement decisions in the physical world. (Ref: Page 8)

**14. Why are unique identifiers important for IoT devices and objects?**
**Answer:** They ensure each device or object can be uniquely referenced, linked to its data, and managed within large-scale IoT systems.
**Explanation:** The discussion on device identification stresses addressability and traceability via UIDs. (Ref: Page 11)

**15. Briefly describe how a closed-loop control system works in an IoT context.**
**Answer:** Sensors measure a parameter, the system compares it to a target, and actuators automatically adjust the environment based on this feedback.
**Explanation:** The thermostat-style example illustrates sensor–controller–actuator feedback. (Ref: Page 9)

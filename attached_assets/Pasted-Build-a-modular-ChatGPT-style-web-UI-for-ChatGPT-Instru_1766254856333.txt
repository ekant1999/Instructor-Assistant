Build a modular, ChatGPT-style web UI for “ChatGPT Instructor Assistant”

The app is chat-first. The front page must look and behave like ChatGPT, while all other pages are fully modular, independent, and lazy-loaded.

1. Tech Stack (strict)

React + TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

Zustand (minimal global state)

React Router

Mock API calls only (no real API keys)

2. Global App Rules (important)

Chat is the primary interface

Chat persists across all pages

Each page is self-contained and removable

Pages communicate only via typed events

Dark mode ready

Clean, minimal, ChatGPT-like UX

3. App Layout
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Top Bar: Logo | Chat | Library | Notes | QSets│
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Main Page Content (route-based)               │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Sticky Chat Input (ChatGPT-style)             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. FRONT PAGE — Chat (Default Route /)

This must feel like ChatGPT.
